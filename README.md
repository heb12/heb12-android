This is a simple android prototype of Heb12 made in MIT's App Inventor. Please note that this is not the final version. It will be re-created in something more powerful, like Android Studio later on.

This app is based on [Heb12 Desktop](https://github.com/heb12/heb12). It was started by @Pufflegamerz.
