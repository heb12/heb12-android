# Heb12 for Android (will support iOS soon!)
This is a simple android prototype of Heb12 made in MIT's App Inventor. Please note that this is not the final version. It will be re-created in something more powerful, like Android Studio later on.

This app is based on [Heb12 Desktop](https://github.com/heb12/heb12). It was started by @Pufflegamerz. 

## Planned Additions and Fixes for 1.1:
1. Turn the settings button into a cog icon
2. Cleaner interface
3. Add the Heb12 icon
4.
